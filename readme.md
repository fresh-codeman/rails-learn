## Problems to solve to learn all the above concepts
1Ô∏è‚É£ Basics of Ruby
üíª Problem: Write a program that takes a user's name and age as input and prints a greeting message.
Input: "Alice", 25
Output: "Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old."
2Ô∏è‚É£ Control Structures
üíª Problem: Write a program that checks if a given number is prime.
Input: 7
Output: true
3Ô∏è‚É£ Methods & Blocks
üíª Problem: Create a method calculate that takes two numbers and a block, applying the block to those numbers.
calculate(5, 3) { |a, b| a + b } # Output: 8
calculate(10, 2) { |a, b| a * b } # Output: 20
4Ô∏è‚É£ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
üíª Problem: Create a Car class with attributes brand and speed. Add a method accelerate that increases the speed.
car = Car.new("Toyota", 50)
car.accelerate(20) # Output: "Toyota is now going at 70 km/h."
5Ô∏è‚É£ Modules & Metaprogramming
üíª Problem: Create a module Driveable with a method drive. Include it in the Car class.
car.drive # Output: "The car is driving."
üíª Problem: Use method_missing to catch undefined method calls and return a custom error message.
Input: obj.some_unknown_method
Output: "Method some_unknown_method is not defined!"
6Ô∏è‚É£ Collections & Enumerables
üíª Problem: Given an array of numbers, return a new array containing only even numbers.
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [2, 4, 6]
üíª Problem: Implement a custom map method using yield.
Input: my_map([1, 2, 3]) { |n| n * 2 }
Output: [2, 4, 6]
7Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling & Debugging
üíª Problem: Write a program that attempts to divide two numbers but handles ZeroDivisionError.
Input: divide(10, 0)
Output: "Cannot divide by zero!"
8Ô∏è‚É£ File Handling & I/O
üíª Problem: Write a Ruby program to read a text file and count the number of words.
Input: "hello.txt" (contains: "Hello world!")
Output: 2
9Ô∏è‚É£ Ruby Internals & Performance
üíª Problem: Implement a basic caching system using a Hash in Ruby.

Output: "Computed: 55", "Cached: 55"
üîü Advanced Ruby Topics
üíª Problem: Create a thread-based counter that counts from 1 to 10 in the background while the main program continues running.
